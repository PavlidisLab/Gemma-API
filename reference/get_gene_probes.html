    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>gene</dt>
<dd><p>An ensembl gene identifier which typically starts with ensg or an ncbi gene identifier or an official gene symbol approved by hgnc</p></dd>


<dt>offset</dt>
<dd><p>The offset of the first retrieved result.</p></dd>


<dt>limit</dt>
<dd><p>Defaults to 20. Limits the result to specified amount
of objects. Has a maximum value of 100. Use together with <code>offset</code> and
the <code>totalElements</code> <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html" class="external-link">attribute</a> in the output to
compile all data if needed.</p></dd>


<dt>raw</dt>
<dd><p><code>TRUE</code> to receive results as-is from Gemma, or <code>FALSE</code> to enable
parsing. Raw results usually contain additional fields and flags that are
omitted in the parsed results.</p></dd>


<dt>memoised</dt>
<dd><p>Whether or not to save to cache for future calls with the
same inputs and use the result saved in cache if a result is already saved.
Doing <code>options(gemma.memoised = TRUE)</code> will ensure that the cache is always
used. Use <code><a href="forget_gemma_memoised.html">forget_gemma_memoised</a></code> to clear the cache.</p></dd>


<dt>file</dt>
<dd><p>The name of a file to save the results to, or <code>NULL</code> to not write
results to a file. If <code>raw == TRUE</code>, the output will be the raw endpoint from the
API, likely a JSON or a gzip file. Otherwise, it will be a RDS file.</p></dd>


<dt>overwrite</dt>
<dd><p>Whether or not to overwrite if a file exists at the specified
filename.</p></dd>

</dl></div>
    <div id="value">
    <h2>Value</h2>
    

<p>A data table with information about the probes representing a gene across
all platrofms. A list if <code>raw = TRUE</code>.
A <code>404 error</code> if the given identifier does not map to any genes.</p>


<p>The fields of the output data.table are:</p>


<ul><li><p><code>element.name</code>: Name of the element. Typically the probeset name</p></li>
<li><p><code>element.description</code>: A free text field providing optional information about the element</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.shortName</code>: Shortname of the platform given by Gemma. Typically the GPL identifier.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.name</code>: Full name of the platform</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.ID</code>: Id number of the platform given by Gemma</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.type</code>: Type of the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.description</code>: Free text field describing the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.troubled</code>: Whether the platform is marked as troubled by a Gemma curator.</p></li>
<li><p><code>taxon.name</code>: Name of the species platform was made for</p></li>
<li><p><code>taxon.scientific</code>: Scientific name for the taxon</p></li>
<li><p><code>taxon.ID</code>: Internal identifier given to the species by Gemma</p></li>
<li><p><code>taxon.NCBI</code>: NCBI ID of the taxon</p></li>
<li><p><code>taxon.database.name</code>: Underlying database used in Gemma for the taxon</p></li>

The set includes over 1,000,000 unique oligonucleotide features covering more than 39,000 transcript variants, which in turn represent greater than 33,000 of the best characterized human genes. Sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from Build 133 of UniGene (April 20, 2001) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz golden-path human genome database (April 2001 release). In addition, ESTs were analyzed for untrimmed low-quality sequence information, correct orientation, false priming, false clustering, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation.

The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBank®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).

Early mouse embryos were exposed to various teratogens during neurulation stages with the aim of correlating large-scale changes in gene expression with a generic histopathological biomarker (p53 protein induction) across the critical period during exposure, and with the risk of malformations in term fetuses (the various exposure scenarios produce ~10% risk of malformations in term fetuses averaged across 50 conditions of the experiment). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from the embryo, prosencephalon, or headfold. Each condition for microarray analysis was replicated with independent sampling and reversal of labeling assignments (100 samples total). DTME compares genes expressed between test vs. reference samples as evidenced by data from two-channel MICROMAX system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Wellesley, MA 02481-4078, USA). It also includes a series of comparisons of early optic development in the optic primordium from mouse and rat embryos harvested at equivalent morphogenetic stages. The microarray platform uses a novel integrative chemistry that culminates massive signal amplification and greatly enhanced detection. The method incorporates unique two-channel indirect labeling of target RNA products with biotinyl-11-dCTP and fluorescein-12-dCTP (or dinitrophenol-11-dCTP) with post-hybridization amplification through conventional immunodetection and tyramide signal amplification. The probe was spotted with 2.4K sequence-verified human gene elements (single or duplicate) from 50 different cDNA libraries and positive- and negative- control genes. The cDNAs represent more than 10 different tissue sources: 80% brain-derived and more than 40% full-length cDNA sequences and a range of human diseases, metabolic, and regulatory pathways. The probe has been shown effective with target RNA from human, mouse, or rat biosources. The dataset includes "absolute" and "relative" values. Absolute values represent the background-corrected signal. For single-spot 2400 arrays this means one measurement for every spotted element and each color channel. Relative values represent ratiometric data normalized as follows: transformation to log2-space; lowess correction of MxA plot; internal standardization by mean absolute deviation; and normalization between replica pairs in each condition.

We analyzed NT samples from 38 patients undergoing surgery at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, during May 1996 ? May 2001. All samples were collected with informed consent and ethical committee approval and were grossly dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 minutes of removal. Initial diagnosis of each sample  from frozen section was later confirmed by detailed analysis of paraffin sections and immunohistochemistry. Following WHO guidelines,1 17 tumours were classified as SCLC including two combined SCLC with adenocarcinoma (SCLC-AD), 8 as LCNEC, including 2 combined LCNEC with AD (LCNEC-AD), 12 as TC and 1 as AC. The prevalence of LCNEC as a percentage all lung cancer resected at the Cancer Institute during the period was 2.7%. Since LCNEC is described as a variant of large cell carcinoma MAGE(LCC), we also analyzed thirteen LCC samples. Twelve well differentiated  AD samples were included to aid interpretation of expression profiles for the SCLC-AD and LCNEC-AD samples, and to allow identification of markers that distinguish NT from non-small cell lung cancer. We included thirty normal lung samples from unrelated individuals. Finally 11 SCLC cell lines were incorporated into the analysis.

We analyzed NT samples from 38 patients undergoing surgery at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, during May 1996 ? May 2001. All samples were collected with informed consent and ethical committee approval and were grossly dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 minutes of removal. Initial diagnosis of each sample  from frozen section was later confirmed by detailed analysis of paraffin sections and immunohistochemistry. Following WHO guidelines,1 17 tumours were classified as SCLC including two combined SCLC with adenocarcinoma (SCLC-AD), 8 as LCNEC, including 2 combined LCNEC with AD (LCNEC-AD), 12 as TC and 1 as AC. The prevalence of LCNEC as a percentage all lung cancer resected at the Cancer Institute during the period was 2.7%. Since LCNEC is described as a variant of large cell carcinoma MAGE(LCC), we also analyzed thirteen LCC samples. Twelve well differentiated  AD samples were included to aid interpretation of expression profiles for the SCLC-AD and LCNEC-AD samples, and to allow identification of markers that distinguish NT from non-small cell lung cancer. We included thirty normal lung samples from unrelated individuals. Finally 11 SCLC cell lines were incorporated into the analysis. Full clinical details of all tumour samples and cell lines are provided in supplementary table 1. Reference RNA, a mixture of lung cancer cell lines and normal lung, is exactly as described previously.5 Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, or The RIKEN cell bank. cDNA microarray Each microarray contains 40,368 elements, of which 39,936 are derived from IMAGE cDNA clones purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, Alabama). This clone set was supplemented with 384 proprietary clones and 48 control elements.
