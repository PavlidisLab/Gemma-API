    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>gene</dt>
<dd><p>An ensembl gene identifier which typically starts with ensg or an ncbi gene identifier or an official gene symbol approved by hgnc</p></dd>


<dt>offset</dt>
<dd><p>The offset of the first retrieved result.</p></dd>


<dt>limit</dt>
<dd><p>Optional, defaults to 20. Limits the result to specified amount
of objects. Has a maximum value of 100. Use together with <code>offset</code> and
the <code>totalElements</code> <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html" class="external-link">attribute</a> in the output to
compile all data if needed.</p></dd>


<dt>raw</dt>
<dd><p><code>TRUE</code> to receive results as-is from Gemma, or <code>FALSE</code> to enable
parsing. Raw results usually contain additional fields and flags that are
omitted in the parsed results.</p></dd>


<dt>memoised</dt>
<dd><p>Whether or not to save to cache for future calls with the
same inputs and use the result saved in cache if a result is already saved.
Doing <code>options(gemma.memoised = TRUE)</code> will ensure that the cache is always
used. Use <code><a href="forget_gemma_memoised.html">forget_gemma_memoised</a></code> to clear the cache.</p></dd>


<dt>file</dt>
<dd><p>The name of a file to save the results to, or <code>NULL</code> to not write
results to a file. If <code>raw == TRUE</code>, the output will be a JSON file. Otherwise,
it will be a RDS file.</p></dd>


<dt>overwrite</dt>
<dd><p>Whether or not to overwrite if a file exists at the specified
filename.</p></dd>


<dt>attributes</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>TRUE</code> additional information from the call will be added
into the output object's attributes such as offset and available elements.</p></dd>

</dl></div>
    <div id="value">
    <h2>Value</h2>
    

<p>A data table with information about the probes representing a gene across
all platrofms. A list if <code>raw = TRUE</code>.
A <code>404 error</code> if the given identifier does not map to any genes.</p>


<p>The fields of the output data.table are:</p>


<ul><li><p><code>mapping.name</code>: Name of the mapping. Typically the probeset name</p></li>
<li><p><code>mappping.description</code>: A free text field providing optional information about the mapping</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.ShortName</code>: Shortname of the platform given by Gemma. Typically the GPL identifier.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.Name</code>: Full name of the platform</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.ID</code>: Id number of the platform given by Gemma</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.Taxon</code>: Species the platform was designed for</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.TaxonID</code>: Id number of the species given by Gemma</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.Type</code>: Type of the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.Description</code>: Free text field describing the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>platform.Troubled</code>: Whether the platform is marked as troubled by a Gemma curator.</p></li>

Many of the toxicology markers used in the design of this microarray were released to the public domain for the first time and will be used on this unique microarray product.  Arrays of this design have barcodes that begin with 16011868 or 2511868.  Orientation: Features are numbered numbered Left-to-Right, Top-to-Bottom as scanned by an Agilent scanner (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass), matching the FeatureNum output from Agilent's Feature Extraction software.  The ID column represents the Agilent Feature Extraction feature number.  Rows and columns are numbered as scanned by an Axon Scanner (barcode on the bottom, DNA on the front surface).  To match data scanned on an Axon scanner, use the RefNumber column contained in the Agilent-provided GAL file as the ID_REF column in sample submissions. \nFrom GPL890\nLast Updated: Sep 22 2005</span>

Each transcript is represented by a 30-mer probe which is designed to conserved exons across the transcripts of targeted genes. The probe sequences, representing well annotated, full length and partial rat gene sequences, were designed based on sequences selected from the NCBI UniGene build #129, RefSeq database (April 1, 2004 release) and dbEST database (March 20, 2004 release).  Well-annotated mRNA or coding sequences were chosen to ensure usefulness for a large range of applications in basic research, biotechnology, and drug development. Each sequence was carefully screened to ensure high-quality, specific probe design, and to reduce redundancy of gene targets. All of the probes designed to these sequences were functionally tested, and over 95% were functionally validated against 10 rat tissues to ensure best representation of the gene and biologically relevant results. For flexibility and data preservation, CodeLink Rat Whole Genome Bioarrays are compatible with lower density CodeLink rat bioarrays. This means that existing data from CodeLink UniSet? Rat 10K Bioarrays can be continuously used in future studies along with newly generated data from CodeLink Rat Whole Genome Bioarrays.  CodeLink users can submit data to GEO by exporting tab-delimited text files from the CodeLink software. The "Feature_id" header will need to be renamed to "ID_REF", and the "Normalized_intensity" header to "VALUE" before uploading the exported tables.  In addition, users are encouraged to include additional raw data columns in their data uploads. These additional columns do not need to be renamed. </span>

Identifying patterns of differential mRNA expression over a large set of genes is an excellent method to identify targets, characterize action mechanisms, and make initial predictions of global drug effects. Well-annotated mRNA or coding sequences were chosen from the entire UniGene set to ensure usefulness to a large range of researchers in basic research, biotechnology, and drug development applications. Each sequence was carefully screened to reduce gene redundancy and to design high-quality specific probes.  CodeLink users can submit data to GEO by exporting tab-delimited text files from the CodeLink software. The "Feature_id" header will need to be renamed to "ID_REF", and the "Normalized_intensity" header to "VALUE" before uploading the exported tables.  In addition, users are encouraged to include additional raw data columns in their data uploads. These additional columns do not need to be renamed. </span>

Each sequence was carefully screened to ensure high-quality, specific probe design, and to reduce redundancy of gene targets. All of the probes designed to these sequences were functionally tested, and over 95% were functionally validated against 10 rat tissues to ensure best representation of the gene and biologically relevant results.
