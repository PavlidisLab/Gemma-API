The search query. Either plain text ('traumatic'), or an ontology term
URI ('http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002048'). Datasets that
contain the given string in their short of full name will also be
matched ('GSE201', 'Bronchoalveolar lavage samples'.

can either be Taxon ID, Taxon NCBI ID, or one of its string identifiers:
scientific name, common name
It is recommended to use Taxon ID for efficiency.
Please note, that not all taxa have all the possible identifiers
available.
Use the 'All Taxa' endpoint to retrieve the necessary information. For
convenience, below is a list of officially supported taxa:
ID   Comm.name   Scient.name                NcbiID</p>

    <tr>
      <th>filter</th>
      <td><p>Optional, defaults to <code>empty</code>.
Filtering can be done on any* property or nested property that the
appropriate object class defines or inherits (and that is mapped by
hibernate). [These do not correspond to the properties of the objects
returned by the API calls.].description-imp
Class definitions:</p><ul>
<li><p>Datasets:
<a href='http://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/resources/apidocs/ubic/gemma/model/expression/experiment/ExpressionExperiment.html'>javaDoc</a>     <a href='https://github.com/ppavlidis/Gemma/blob/development/gemma-core/src/main/java/ubic/gemma/model/expression/experiment/ExpressionExperiment.java'>gitHub</a></p></li>

E.g: <code>curationDetails</code> or <code>curationDetails.lastTroubledEvent.date</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Any property of a supported type. Currently supported types are:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>String - property of String type, required value can be any String.</p></li>
<li><p>Number - any Number implementation. Required value must be a string
parseable to the specific Number type.</p></li>
<li><p>Boolean - required value will be parsed to true only if the string
matches 'true', ignoring case.
Accepted operator keywords are:</p></li>
<li><p>'=' - equality</p></li>
<li><p>'!=' - non-equality</p></li>
<li><p>'&lt;' - smaller than</p></li>
<li><p>'&gt;' - larger than</p></li>
<li><p>'&lt;=' - smaller or equal</p></li>
<li><p>'=&gt;' - larger or equal</p></li>
<li><p>'like' - similar string, effectively means 'contains',
translates to the sql 'LIKE' operator (given value will be
surrounded by % signs)
Multiple filters can be chained using <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> keywords.
Leave space between the keywords and the previous/next word!
E.g: <code>?filter=property1 &lt; value1 AND property2 like value2</code>
If chained filters are mixed conjunctions and disjunctions, the query
must be in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Parentheses are not necessary</p></li>
<li><p>every AND keyword separates blocks of disjunctions.
Example:
<code>?filter=p1 = v1 OR p1 != v2 AND p2 &lt;= v2 AND p3 &gt; v3 OR p3 &lt; v4</code>
Above query will translate to:
<code>(p1 = v1 OR p1 != v2) AND (p2 &lt;= v2) AND (p3 &gt; v3 OR p3 &lt; v4;)</code>
Breaking the CNF results in an error.
Filter <code>curationDetails.troubled</code> will be ignored if user is not an
administrator.</p></li>

      <th>limit</th>
      <td><p>Optional, defaults to <code>20</code>.
Limits the result to specified amount of objects. Use 0 for no limit.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>sort</th>
      <td><p>Optional, defaults to <code>+id</code>.
Sets the ordering property and direction.
Format is <code>[+,-][property name]</code>. E.g. <code>-accession</code> will translate to
descending ordering by the 'Accession' property.
Note that this does [not guarantee the order of the returned
entities!].description-imp This is merely a signal to how the data
should be pre-sorted before the limit and offset are applied.
Nested properties are also supported (recursively).
E.g: <code>+curationDetails.lastTroubledEvent.date</code>
When
using in scripts, remember to URL-encode the '+' plus character (see
the compiled URL below).</p></td>

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p>An array of datasets (expression experiment value objects) that are
annotated with the given ontology terms, or, in case of plaintext query,
experiments that contain the given words (name, short name, accession,
tags)
If an ontology term URI is given, the results will also include datasets
that are associated with the descendants of the term.
The search only only checks the annotations value, not the category
(which is also an ontology term).</p>

We used microarray technology (Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips) to determine the expression of approximately 22 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue (orbitofrontal cortex) from patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. Orbitofrontal cortex tissue from a cohort of 30 subjects was investigated and the final analysis included 10 bipolar and 11 control subjects. Differences between disease and control groups were identified using a rigorous statistical analysis with correction for confounding variables and multiple testing.\nNote: [] samples from this series, which appear in other Expression Experiments in Gemma, were not imported from the GEO source.

#&gt;  2: Schwann cells, expanded in number by exposure to growth factors in vitro, could be useful in nervous system repair. Our previous results suggest that long term exposure to heregulin and forskolin changes the functional properties of the human Schwann cells, including the ability to myelinate axons after transplantation. Here, we propose to determine the molecular changes in the Schwann cells that occur as a result of extended growth with mitogenic factors. We believe that the information obtained in these studies will provide clues about mechanisms underlying the already observed changes in function. This information will aid in the prediction of the safety and efficacy of neural repair approaches that use cultured, expanded Schwann cells. Finally this data may provide clues into the mechanisms underlying normal human Schwann cell function. To use gene array analysis to compare gene expression profiles in early and late passage human Schwann cells exposed to the growth factors heregulin and forskolin. Observed changes in the function of human Schwann cells, including their capacity for growth and differentiation, after prolonged exposure to heregulin and forskolin, are caused by changes in the gene expression profiles in these cells. Nerves from four different donors were obtained within 12-15 h postmortem, with full consent for research from the families of the donors (faxed). IRB approval not required because subjects were officially dead at nerve harvest (IRB confirmation faxed). The nerve tissue obtained consisted of the lower 15 cm of nerve extending from mid calf to ankle. Endoneurial fascicles were dissected from short (1-2 cm) nerve fragments and cultured with heregulin and forskolin for 1 week.  The nerve fascicles were then treated overnight with collagenase and dispase and dissociated by gentle trituration.  Cells were plated at low density on laminin coated dishes and maintained in culture with mitogens for 3 passages.  Schwann cell purities during this period were &gt; 95%.   RNA was extracted from the cells  at passage 1 ( i.e. after 2 population doublings) and passage 3 (i.e. after 8 population doublings)  from the following donors: SN HSC 330, age 51; SN HSC 317, age 29; SN HSC 329, age 20 and SN HSC 351, age 42.  Thus eight samples (2 groups, 4 independent samples per group) are to be analyzed. Because both groups in this comparison have been exposed to mitogens, differences in gene expression profiles will be interpreted as indicative of changes caused by prolonged versus short term exposure to mitogens. More RNA was prepared from each group of cells than was needed for gene array analysis to allow confirmation of differentially-expressed gene transcripts by real-time RT-PCR. Since the main purpose of this project is to detect any major changes in the molecular properties of the Schwann cells, we propose that these samples be analyzed using Affymetrix U133 + 2 arrays containing the complete human genome and request Option 1: Start to Finish Profiling of all samples.  We have contacted Dr Stanley Nelson at UCLA and discussed the project with him. We request that the samples be analyzed in the UCLA facility.\nNote: [] samples from this series, which appear in other Expression Experiments in Gemma, were not imported from the GEO source.

We used microarray technology (Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips) to determine the expression of approximately 22 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. A cohort of 70 subjects was investigated and the final analysis included 30 bipolar and 31 control subjects. Differences between disease and control groups were identified using a rigorous statistical analysis with correction for confounding variables and multiple testing.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jan 16 2007\nContributors:  Helen E Lockstone Stephen J Huffaker Matthew T Wayland Sabine Bahn Maree J Webster Margaret M Ryan\nIncludes GDS2190.\n Update date: Aug 28 2006.\n Dataset description GDS2190: Analysis of postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 30 adults with bipolar disorder.

To minimize genetic variation in gene expression levels between cases and controls we compared expression profiles in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the disease. We identified 82 genes that were differentially expressed by ? 1.3-fold in 3 BD1 cases compared to their co-twins, and which were statistically (p ? 0.05) differentially expressed between the groups of BD1 cases and controls. Using qRT-PCR we confirmed the differential expression of some of these genes, including: KCNK1, MAL, PFN2, TCF7, PGK1, and PI4KCB, in at least 2 of the twin pairs. In contrast to the findings of a previous study by Kakiuchi and colleagues with similar discordant BD1 twin design1 our data do not support the dysregulation of XBP1 and HSPA5. From pathway and gene ontology analysis we identified up-regulation of the WNT signalling pathway and the biological process of apoptosis. The differentially regulated genes and pathways identified in this study may provide insights into the biology of BD1.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 20 2007\nContributors:  Louisa Windus Nicholas Matigian Bryan Mowry Cheryl Filippich John McGrath Heather Smith Nicholas Hayward Christos Pantelis

RNA was isolated from these cell populations, amplified, and analysed using Affymetrix HG133plus2.0 GeneChips. In the first instance, we used the dataset to compare the neuronal and endothelial data, in order to demonstrate that the predicted differences between cell types could be detected using this methodology. \nLast Updated (by provider): Dec 18 2008\nContributors:  Margaret M Ryan Thomas Giger Martin J Lan Matthew T Wayland Mark Kotter Michael L Mimmack Laura W Harris Lan Wang Irene Wuethrich Helen Lockstone Sabine Bahn

By comparing the gene expression profiles of similar but distinctive mental disorders, we explored the uniqueness of bipolar disorder and its similarity to other mental disorders at the molecular level. Notably, most of the altered gene expressions in each disease were not shared by one another, suggesting the molecular distinctiveness of these mental disorders. We found a tendency of downregulation of the genes encoding receptor, channels or transporters, and upregulation of the genes encoding stress response proteins or molecular chaperons in bipolar disorder. Altered expressions in bipolar disorder shared by other mental disorders mainly consisted of upregulation of the genes encoding proteins for transcription or translation. The genes identified in this study would be useful for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, as well as the common pathophysiological background in major mental disorders at the molecular level.\nLast Updated (by provider): Mar 15 2009\nContributors:  Tadafumi Kato Kazuya Iwamoto Chihiro Kakiuchi Kazuhiko Ikeda Miki Bundo

We performed large-scale DNA microarray analysis of postmortem brains of patients with BD or SZ, and examined expression patterns of mitochondria-related genes. We found a global down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, such as those encoding respiratory chain components, in BD and SZ samples, even after the effect of sample pH was controlled. However, this was likely due to the effects of medication. Medication-free patients with BD showed tendency of up-regulation of subset of mitochondrial genes. Our findings support the mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of BD and SZ pathologies. However, it may be the expression changes of a small fraction of mitochondrial genes rather than the global down-regulation of mitochondrial genes. Our findings warrant further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in BD and SZ. \nLast Updated (by provider): Mar 15 2009\nContributors:  Tadafumi Kato Kazuya Iwamoto Miki Bundo

Using an unbiased genetic approach in a mouse model, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) influencing anxiety-like behaviors and beta-carboline-induced seizure vulnerability have been mapped to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 10 and an interval specific congenic strain (ISCS; A.B6chr10; 66 cM to telomere) was developed. This A.B6chr10 strain facilitated defining the behavioral influences of this region as well as gene expression profiling to identify candidate gene(s) underlying this QTL. By microarray studies, an unsuspected E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Ring Finger 41 (Rnf41 / Neuregulin Receptor Degrading Protein1; Nrdp1) was differentially expressed in the region of interest, comparing the hippocampi of A/J vs A.B6chr10 mice as well as A/J vs B6 mice. By RT-PCR, Rnf41 expression levels were significantly increased 1.5 and 1.3-fold in the hippocampi of C57BL6/J and A.B6chr10 mice compared to A/J mice, respectively. In addition, protein levels of Rnf41 were increased in hippocampi of B6 mice compared to A/J mice across postnatal development with a 5.5-fold difference at P56. Among LxS recombinant inbred mice (N=33), Rnf41 hippocampal mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with open field behavior (r= .454, p=.0073). Re-analyzing a microarray database of human post-mortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann’s Area 46/10), RNF41 mRNA expression levels were reduced significantly in patients with major depression and bipolar disorder compared to unaffected controls.

Using an unbiased genetic approach in a mouse model, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) influencing anxiety-like behaviors and beta-carboline-induced seizure vulnerability have been mapped to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 10 and an interval specific congenic strain (ISCS; A.B6chr10; 66 cM to telomere) was developed. This A.B6chr10 strain facilitated defining the behavioral influences of this region as well as gene expression profiling to identify candidate gene(s) underlying this QTL. By microarray studies, an unsuspected E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Ring Finger 41 (Rnf41 / Neuregulin Receptor Degrading Protein1; Nrdp1) was differentially expressed in the region of interest, comparing the hippocampi of A/J vs A.B6chr10 mice as well as A/J vs B6 mice. By RT-PCR, Rnf41 expression levels were significantly increased 1.5 and 1.3-fold in the hippocampi of C57BL6/J and A.B6chr10 mice compared to A/J mice, respectively. In addition, protein levels of Rnf41 were increased in hippocampi of B6 mice compared to A/J mice across postnatal development with a 5.5-fold difference at P56. Among LxS recombinant inbred mice (N=33), Rnf41 hippocampal mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with open field behavior (r= .454, p=.0073). Re-analyzing a microarray database of human post-mortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann’s Area 46/10), RNF41 mRNA expression levels were reduced significantly in patients with major depression and bipolar disorder compared to unaffected controls. Overall, Rnf41 is a pleiotropic candidate gene for anxiety-like behaviors, depression, and vulnerability to seizures. RNF41 and its binding partners provide novel etiological pathways for influencing behavior, highlighting a potential role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in psychiatric illness.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jan 15 2010\nContributors:  H K Gershenfeld Sanghyeon Kim K Choi R Reister A F Baykiz S Zhang

Examining the gene expression patterns in these two cell types will provide valuable information regarding the validity of using them to study gene expression related to various human diseases. Fibroblasts and LCLs from four members of the Old Order Amish family 884 were purchased from Coriell cell repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). We used microarrays to profile the patterns of gene expression in these eight cell lines. By employing the PennCNV algorithm to the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP genotyping data, we detected 13 Copy Number Variants (CNV) that exist in these four individuals. CNV-expression association analysis revealed that seven of these 13 CNVs were associated with the expression of genes within or near (&lt;2Mb sweep) these CNVs at a nominal regression P value of 0.05.\nLast Updated (by provider): Feb 20 2009\nContributors:  Maja Bucan Shuzhang Yang

Contemporary models for the manic pole of BPD have primarily utilized either single locus transgenics or treatment with psychostimulants.  Our lab recently characterized a mouse strain, termed Madison (MSN), which naturally displays a manic phenotype, exhibiting elevated locomotor activity, increased sexual behavior, and higher forced swimming relative to control strains.  Lithium chloride and olanzapine treatments attenuate this phenotype.  In this study, we replicated our locomotor activity experiment, showing that MSN mice display generationally-stable mania relative to their outbred ancestral strain, hsd:ICR (ICR).  We then performed a gene expression microarray experiment to compare hippocampus of MSN and ICR mice.  We found dysregulation of multiple transcripts whose human orthologs are associated with BPD and other psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and ADHD, including: Epor, Smarca4, Cmklr1, Cat, Tac1, Npsr1, Fhit, and P2rx7.  RT-qPCR confirmed dysregulation for all of seven transcripts tested.  Using a network analysis, we found dysregulation of a gene system related to chromatin packaging, a result convergent with recent human findings on BPD.  Using a novel genomic enrichment algorithm, we found enrichment in genome regions homologous to human loci implicated in BPD in replicated linkage studies including homologs of human cytobands 1p36, 3p14, 3q29, 6p21-22, 12q24, 16q24, and 17q25.  Our findings suggest that MSN mice represent a polygenic model for the manic pole of BPD showing much of the genetic systems complexity of the corresponding human disorder.  Further, the high degree of convergence between our findings and the human literature on BPD brings up novel questions about evolution by analogy in mammalian genomes.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 06 2012\nContributors:  Stephen C Gammie Griffin M Gessay Michael C Saul

The first genome-wide significant association with the broad phenotype of psychosis was with a polymorphism in the ZNF804A gene. However, the biological function(s) of ZNF804A have, to date, been entirely unknown. In this study, we manipulated the expression of ZNF804A in neural progenitor cells derived from human cortical neuroepithelium and assessed its effects on the cellular transcriptome. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated a significant effect of ZNF804A knockdown on the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, suggesting a role for ZNF804A in processes such as neural migration, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Several highly significant gene expression changes were confirmed in repeat cell culture experiments. Most consistent gene expression changes were seen for C2ORF80, a gene of as yet unknown function, and STMN3, a gene involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal and dendritic branching. These data, generated in a hypothesis-free manner, provide a basis for more targeted investigations of ZNF804A function.\nLast Updated (by provider): Sep 24 2012\nContributors:  Aaron Jeffries Richard Dobson Matthew Hill Nick Bray Jack Price

Yet no single genetic variant has accounted for more than a small fraction of cases. We sought to determine whether we could classify patients as having ASD vs. controls solely based on a multi-gene expression profiling of their peripheral blood cells.\nLast Updated (by provider): \nContributors:  Isaac S Kohane Ingrid A Holm Christin Collins Louis M Kunkel SekWon Kong

The aim of this investigation was to search for dysregulated molecular and cellular pathways for these disorders as well as psychosis. We conducted a blood-based microarray investigation in two independent samples with SCZ and BPD from San Diego (SCZ=13, BPD=9, control=8) and Taiwan [data not included](SCZ=11, BPD=14, control=16). Diagnostic groups were compared to controls, and subjects with a history of psychosis [PSYCH(+): San Diego (n=6), Taiwan (n=14)] were compared to subjects without such history [PSYCH(-): San Diego (n=11), Taiwan (n=14)]. Analyses of covariance comparing mean expression levels on a gene-by-gene basis were conducted to generate the top 100 significantly dysregulated gene lists for both samples by each diagnostic group. Gene lists were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Results showed the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPS) was listed in the top ten canonical pathways for BPD and psychosis diagnostic groups across both samples with a considerably low likelihood of a chance occurrence (p = .001). No overlap in dysregulated genes populating these pathways was observed between the two independent samples. Findings provide preliminary evidence of UPS dysregulation in BPD and psychosis as well as support further investigation of the UPS and other molecular and cellular pathways for potential biomarkers for SCZ, BPD, and/or psychosis. The aim of this investigation was to search for dysregulated molecular and cellular pathways for these disorders as well as psychosis.\nLast Updated (by provider): Oct 19 2012\nContributors:  Sharon D Chandler Chad A Bousman Ian P Everall Erick Tatro Stephen J Glatt Ming T Tsuang James Lohr Ginger Lucero Gursharan Chana William Kremen

Associated genetic and gene expression changes have been identified, but many have not been replicated and have unknown functions. We identified groups of genes whose expressions varied together, that is co-expression modules, then tested them for association with SCZ. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we show that two modules were differentially expressed in patients versus controls. One, upregulated in cerebral cortex, was enriched with neuron differentiation and neuron development genes, as well as disease genome-wide association study genetic signals; the second, altered in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, was enriched with genes involved in neuron protection functions. The findings were preserved in five expression data sets, including sets from three brain\nregions, from a different microarray platform, and from BD patients. From those observations, we propose neuron differentiation and development pathways may be involved in etiologies of both SCZ and BD, and neuron protection function participates in pathological process of the diseases.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jul 26, 2018\nContributors:  Chao Chen Chunyu Liu Lijun Cheng

It is currently approved for treating patients with schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar I disorder. However, its cellular effects remain elusive. We used microarrays to characterize RNA transcript levels in the brains of mice chronically treated with quetiapine, the neuroleptic haloperidol, or vehicle. We further characterized particular RNA transcripts in cortical cell cultures.\nLast Updated (by provider): Apr 16 2013\nContributors:  Jonathan Pevsner Mari Kondo

While there is evidence that peripheral gene expression differences between patients and controls can be utilized as biomarkers for psychiatric illness, it is unclear whether current use or residual effects of antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication drives much of the differential transcription. We therefore tested whether expression changes in first-episode, never-medicated bipolar patients, can contribute to a biological classifier that is less influenced by medication and could potentially form a practicable biomarker assay for BPD. We employed microarray technology to measure global leukocyte gene expression in first-episode (n=3) and currently medicated BPD patients (n=26), and matched healthy controls (n=25). Following an initial feature selection of the microarray data, we developed a cross-validated 10-gene model that was able to correctly predict the diagnostic group of the training sample (26 medicated patients and 12 controls), with 89% sensitivity and 75% specificity (p&lt;0.001). The 10-gene predictor was further explored via testing on an independent test cohort consisting of three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for BPD, plus the original enrichment sample cohort (the three never-medicated BPD patients and 13 matched control subjects), and a sample of experimental replicates (n=34). 83% of the independent test sample was correctly predicted, with a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 100% (although this result did not reach statistical significance). Additionally, 88% of sample diagnostic classes were classified correctly for both the enrichment (p=0.015) and the replicate samples (p&lt;0.001).\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 25 2013\nContributors:  James D Clelland Catherine L Clelland

To examine the molecular underpinnings of this observation, microarray analysis of singla retinal cells from wildtype (WT) or Notch1 conditional knockout (N1-CKO) retinas was performed. The majority of N1-CKO cells lost expression of known Notch target genes. These cells also had low levels of RPC and cell cycle genes, and robustly upregulated rod precursor genes. In addition, single WT cells, in which cell cycle marker genes were downregulated, expressed markers of both rod photoreceptors and interneurons. These results demonstrate that individual, newly postmitotic retinal cells can begin to differentiate into more than one cell type, and that this transitional state may be dependent on Notch1 signaling. We used microarrays to examine gene expression changes that occur in single cells after the removal of Notch1 during retinal development.\nLast Updated (by provider): Sep 23 2013\nContributors:  Karolina Mizeracka

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate the complexity of gene expression in the human brain. We used RNA-seq to survey the brain transcriptome in high-quality post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 11 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and from 11 age- and gender-matched controls.  Deep sequencing was performed, with over 350 million reads per specimen. At a false-discovery rate of &lt;5%, we detected 5 differentially-expressed (DE) genes and 12 DE transcripts, most of which have not been previously implicated in BD.  Among these, PROM1/CD133 and ABCG2 play important roles in neuroplasticity. We also show for the first time differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BD.  DE transcripts include those of SRSF5 and RFX4, which along with lncRNAs play a role in mammalian circadian rhythms. The DE genes were significantly enriched for several Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Of these, genes involved with GTPase binding were also enriched for BD-associated SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that differential expression of these genes is not simply a consequence of BD or its treatment.  Many of these findings were replicated by microarray in an independent sample of 60 cases and controls. These results highlight common pathways for inherited and non-inherited influences on disease risk that may constitute good targets for novel therapies.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jan 08 2014\nContributors:  Francis J McMahon Nirmala Akula\n [Switched to use Generic_human by Gemma] [Switched to use human_illumina_rnaseq by Gemma] [Switched to use Generic_human by Gemma]

Several risk genes, such as DISC1, have been associated with schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder (BPD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), consistent with the hypothesis that a shared genetic architecture could contribute to divergent clinical syndromes.  The present study compared gene expression profiles across three brain regions in post-mortem tissue from matched subjects with schizophrenia, BPD or MDD and unaffected controls.  Post-mortem brain tissue was collected from control subjects and well-matched subjects with schizophrenia, BPD, and MDD (n=19 from each group).  RNA was isolated from hippocampus, Brodmann Area 46, and associative striatum and hybridized to U133_Plus2 Affymetrix chips.  Data were normalized by RMA, subjected to pairwise comparison followed by Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction (FDR).  Samples derived from patients with schizophrenia exhibited  many more changes in gene expression across all brain regions than observed in BPD or MDD.  Several genes showed changes in both schizophrenia and BPD, though the magnitude of change was usually larger in schizophrenia.  Several genes that have variants associated with schizophrenia were found to have altered expression in multiple regions of brains from subjects with schizophrenia.  Continued evaluation of circuit-level alterations in gene expression and gene-network relationships may further our understanding of how genetic variants may be influencing biological processes to contribute to psychiatric disease.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 19 2014\nContributors:  Thomas A Lanz

It is not known how the intermingled cell types of individual brain regions differ in their expressed genomes. Here we describe an atlas of cell type transcriptomes of the adult retina. We found that each adult cell type expresses a specific set of genes, including a unique set of transcription factors, forming a “barcode” for cell identity. Cell type transcriptomes carry enough information to categorize cells into corresponding morphological classes and types. Surprisingly, several barcode genes are eye disease-associated genes that we demonstrate to be specifically expressed not only in photoreceptors but also in particular retinal circuit elements such as inhibitory neurons as well as in retinal microglia. Our data suggest that distinct cell types of individual brain regions are characterized by marked differences in their expressed genomes. We assembled a library of 22 transgenic mouse lines in which each line had a group of retinal cells marked with fluorescent proteins. We built up the library with the purpose of having some mouse lines in which single retinal cell types and others in which combinations of types from a single class are labeled. The library had mouse lines with labeled cells representing each of the six retinal cell classes. Retinal cells were characterized by physiological recording and immunohistochemical staining. We isolated 200 fluorescent protein-labeled retinal cells (“cell groups”) from at least three different mice of each mouse line by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The transcripts of each cell group of these biological triplicates were independently amplified in batches. Each batch contained an internal control cell group from the Arc-line.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 10 2014\nContributors:  Botond Roska Erik Cabuy Sandra Siegert

Potential candidate genes for AN, BN, and OCD have been identified through clinical association and neuroimaging studies; however, recent genome-wide association studies of eating disorders (ED) so far have failed to report significant findings. Additionally, few if any studies have interrogated postmortem brain tissue for evidence of eQTLs associated with candidate genes, which has particular promise as an approach to elucidating molecular mechanisms of association. We therefore selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on candidate gene studies for AN, BN, and OCD from the literature, and examined the association of these SNPs with gene expression across the lifespan in prefrontal cortex of a non-psychiatric control cohort (N=268).   Several risk-predisposing SNPs were significantly associated with gene expression among control subjects. We then measured gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of cases previously diagnosed with obsessive psychiatric disorders, e.g., eating disorders (ED; N=15), and obsessive-compulsive disorder/obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or tics (OCD/OCPD/Tic; N=16), and non-psychiatric controls (N=102) and identified 6 and 286 genes that were differentially expressed between ED compared to controls and OCD cases compared to controls, respectively (FDR &lt; 5%). However, none of the clinical risk SNPs were among the eQTLs and none were significantly associated with gene expression within the broad obsessive cohort, suggesting larger sample sizes or other brain regions may be required to identify candidate molecular mechanisms of clinical association in postmortem brain datasets.\nLast Updated (by provider): Aug 08 2014\nContributors:  Andrew E Jaffe

Both disorders have a neurodevelopment component, with onset of symptoms occurring most frequently during late adolescence or early adulthood. Genetic findings indicate the existence of an overlap in genetic susceptibility across the disorders. These gene expression profiles were used to identify the molecular mechanisms that differentiate SZ and BP from healthy controls but also that distinguish both from healthy individuals. They were also used to expand an analysis from an experiment that searched molecular alterations in human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts from control subject and individual with schizophrenia and further differentiated to neuron to identify genes relevant for the development of schizophrenia (GSE62105).\nLast Updated (by provider): Oct 14 2014\nContributors:  Leandro Lima Mariana Maschietto Dirce M Carraro Carlos A Filho Angelica de Baumont Luiz A Barreta Paulo Belmonte-de-Abreu Ana C Tahira Eloisa H Olivieri Joana A Palha Helena Brentani Daniel Mariani Alex Fiorini

Recent evidence suggests that skin fibroblasts could represent a non-neural peripheral model useful to investigate molecular alterations in psychiatric disorders. A microarray expression study was conducted comparing transcriptomic profiles of skin fibroblasts from SCZ patients and controls. Fibroblasts can be more advantageous to discover mental disorder aetiological mechanisms since they seem more similar to neurons and less affected by the environmental confounders.\nLast Updated (by provider): Feb 24 2015\nContributors:  Elena Milanesi Nadia Cattane Stefano Bignotti Luisella Bocchio-Chiavetto Marco Bortolomasi Massimo Gennarelli Carlo Maj Alessandra Minelli

However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two murine Neurogenin transcription factors in human induced pluripotent stem cells, and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in four days at greater than 90% purity. The high purity enabled mRNA and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the transition from stem cell to neuron.

We performed gene expression microarray analysis of dentate gyrus from alpha-CaMKII HKO mice. Mice were selected for the sampling such that their LA levels varied among the mice.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jan 03 2017\nContributors:  Hideo HAGIHARA

This particular phenotype suggests that abnormal striatal function could be involved in BD etiology, yet most transcriptomic studies of this disorder have concentrated on cortical brain regions. We report the first transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq of the human dorsal striatum comparing bipolar and control subjects. Differential expression analysis and functional pathway enrichment analysis were performed to identify changes in gene expression that correlate with BD status. Further co-expression and enrichment analyses were performed to identify sets of correlated genes that show association to BD.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 17 2017\nContributors:  Ronald L Davis Rodrigo Pacifico

Given that working memory depends, in part, on neural circuitry that includes pyramidal neurons in layer 3 (L3) and layer 5 (L5) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we sought to determine if transcriptome alterations in these neurons were shared or distinctive for each diagnosis.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jul 05 2017\nContributors:  Dominique Arion David A Lewis John F Enwright George Tseng Zhiguang Huo John P Corradi

CRXp-GFP reporter in H9 line replicates endogenous CRX expression when induced to form self-organizing 3-D retina-like tissue. We define temporal transcriptome dynamics of developing photoreceptors during the establishment of cone and rod cell fate. Our studies provide an essential framework for delineating molecules and cellular pathways that guide human photoreceptor development and should assist in chemical screening and cell-based therapies of retinal degeneration.\nLast Updated (by provider): Nov 14 2017\nContributors:  Kohei Homma Rossukon Kaewkhaw Anand Swaroop Koray D Kaya Jizhong Zou Mahendra Rao Matthew Brooks Vijender Chaitankar

Loss of function mutations in the gene have also been found in schizophrenia (SZ) and intellectual disabilities, and affects cancer cell proliferation. To better understanding the molecular links between CHD8 functions and ASD, we have applied the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knockout (KO) one copy of CHD8 in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and build cerebral organoids, a model for the developing telencephalon. RNA-seq was carried out on KO organoids (CHD8+/-) and isogenic controls (CHD8+/+). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed an enrichment of genes involved in neurogenesis, forebrain development, Wnt/?-catenin signaling and axonal guidance. The SZ and bipolar disorder (BD) candidate gene TCF4 was significantly upregulated. Our CHD8 KO DEGs were significantly overlapped with those found in a transcriptome analysis using cerebral organoids derived from a family with idiopathic ASD and another transcriptome study using iPS cell-derived neurons from patients with BD, a condition characterized in a subgroup of patients by dysregulated WNT/?-catenin signaling. Overall, the findings show that distinct ASD, SZ and BD candidate genes converge on common molecular targets - an important consideration for developing novel therapeutics in genetically heterogeneous complex traits.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 04 2018\nContributors:  Deyou Zheng Herbert M Lachman Ryan Mokhtari Ping Wang Can Bayrak Erika Pedrosa Michael Kirschenbaum

Many of these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain an epigenetic memory of their cellular origins and this in turn may bias their subsequent differentiation. Differentiated neurons are difficult to reprogram and there has not been a systematic side-by-side characterization of reprogramming efficiency or epigenetic memory across different neuronal subtypes. We have recently developed a new method for reprogramming retinal neurons and successfully reprogrammed rod photoreceptors from the murine retina. Here we extended our retinal reprogramming to cone photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, amacrine/horizontal cell interneurons and Müller glia at two different stages of development. We scored the efficiency of reprogramming across all 5 retinal cell types at each developmental stage and we measured retinal differentiation from each iPSC line using a quantitative standardized scoring system called STEM-RET. We discovered that the rod photoreceptors and bipolar neurons had the lowest reprogramming efficiency but iPSCs derived from rods and bipolar cells had the best retinal differentiation. Epigenetic memory was analyzed by characterizing DNA methylation and performing ChIP-seq for 8 histone marks, Brd4, PolII and CTCF. The epigenetic data were integrated with RNA-Seq data from each iPSC line. Retinal cell types with a greater epigenetic barrier to reprogramming (rods and bipolars) are more likely to retain epigenetic memory of their cellular origins. In addition, we identified biomarkers of iPSCs that are predictive of retinal differentiation. This work will have implications for selection of cell populations for cell based therapy and for using reprogramming of purified cell populations to advance our understanding of the role of the epigenome in normal differentiation.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 14 2018\nContributors:  Jiakun Zhang Sharon Frase Suresh Thiagarajan Daniel Hiler Michael A Dyer Dianna Johnson Issam Aldiri Xiang Chen Lyra Griffiths Marie-Elizabeth Barabas Andras Sablauer Beisi Xu Lu Wang Marc Valentine Abbas Shirinifard

In the present study we aimed to find the functional networks influenced by the Wfs1 deficiency in the hypothalamus. We performed gene expression profiling (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays) in Wfs1 deficient mice (ko). Modified t-statistics was used for comparison of groups (wt vs ko). Functional annotation of the alterations in RNA levels was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 305 genes were differentially expressed with nominal p-value less than 0.01. FDR adjusted p-values were significant (0.007) only for two genes – C4b (t=9.66) and Wfs1 (t=-9.03). However, several genes related to the G-protein signalling were very close to the FDR adjusted significance. For instance, Rgs4 (regulator of G-protein signalling 4) was down-regulated (-0.34, t=-5.4) in Wfs1 deficient mice. Changes in Rgs4 and C4B expression were confirmed by QRT-PCR. In humans, Rgs4 is in the locus for bipolar disease (BPD) and its expression is down-regulated in BPD. C4b is the gene related to the neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, hypothalamic gene expression profiling indicates alterations in some functionally relevant molecular pathways explaining the clinical syndrome in the Wolfram syndrome patients.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 11 2017\nContributors:  Leo C Schalkwyk Mario Plaas Anton Terasmaa Valo Tillmann Cathy Fernandes Ursel Soomets Klari Noormets Eero Vasar Sulev Koks\nIncludes GDS4526.\n Update date: Dec 02 2013.\n Dataset description GDS4526: Analysis of hypothalami from Wfs1-knockout, 129SV animals.

Here we describe direct conversion of mouse embryonic and lung fibroblasts to ‘induced’ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) using sets of either eight or three defined transcription factors.  iOPCs exhibit a bipolar morphologyical and global gene expression profile molecular features consistent with bona fide OPCs.  They can be expanded in vitro for at least five passages while retaining the ability to differentiate into induced multiprocessed oligodendrocytes.  When transplanted to hypomyelinated mice, iOPCs are capable of ensheathing host axons and generating compact myelinmyelinating axons both in vitro and in vivo.  Lineage conversion of somatic cells to expandable iOPCs provides a strategy to study the molecular control of oligodendrocyte lineage identity and may facilitate neurological disease modeling and autologous remyelinating therapies.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 11 2017\nContributors:  Fadi Najm Paul J Tesar Angela Lager

Transgenic mice overexpressing IGF-I in the retina showed impaired electroretinographic responses at 6-7 months of age that worsen with age. This retinal neuronal dysfunction was correlated with the loss of rod photoreceptors, bipolar, ganglion and amacrines cells. Neuronal alterations were preceded by the overexpression of  retinal stress markers, acute phase proteins and gliosis-related genes. IGF-I overexpression leads to chronic gliosis and microgliosis in TgIGF-I retinas, with mild oxidative stress, impaired recycling of glutamate and defective potassium buffering. These impaired supportive functions can contribute to neurodegeneration in TgIGF-I retinas, together with the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potential mediators of neuronal death.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 04 2018\nContributors:  Albert Ribera

One of the recent development in cellular reprogramming is the direct reprogramming, that can change cell fate towards different lineages. This strategy provides an alternative to the use of pluripotent stem cells ruling out the concerns of tumorigenicity caused by undifferentiated cell populations. Here, we generated induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) from mouse fibroblasts by direct reprogramming. The generated iOPCs are homogenous, self-renewing, and multipotent. Once differentiated, the somatic stem cells exhibit morphological and molecular characteristics of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Thus, we demonstrated that terminally differentiated somatic cells can be converted into functional iOPCs by induction of transcription factors offering a new strategies to cure myelin disorders.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 11 2017\nContributors:  Holm Zaeres Myung R Park Hyunah Lee Marcos J Arauzo-Bravo Jeong B Kim

The transcriptional programs underlying these processes are not completely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Bcl11a regulates polarity and migration of upper layer neurons. Bcl11a-deficient late-born neurons fail to correctly switch from multipolar to bipolar morphology resulting in impaired radial migration. We show that the expression of Sema3c is increased in migrating Bcl11a-deficient neurons and that Bcl11a is a direct negative regulator of Sema3c transcription. In vivo gain-of-function and rescue experiments demonstrate that Sema3c is a major downstream effector of Bcl11a required for the cell polarity switch and for the migration of upper layer neurons. Our data uncover a novel Bcl11a/Sema3c-dependent regulatory pathway used by migrating cortical neurons.\nLast Updated (by provider): May 11 2017\nContributors:  Swathi Srivatsa Jin Cheng Victor Tarabykin Katharina Peschkes Christoph Wiegreffe Stefan Britsch Neal G Copeland Ruth Simon Michael Strehle Carolin Kling Karlheinz Holzmann Pentao Liu Nancy A Jenkins

Sp4 is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  In order to identify target genes of Sp4, we compared global gene expression in the cerebella of wild type and Sp4 hypomorph mice (Sp4neo-/-; Zhou et al, 2005).  The results identify candidate Sp4 target genes that may contribute to neuronal development and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nLast Updated (by provider): Nov 09 2017\nContributors:  Xinxin Sun Grace Gill

The retina is one of the major energy consuming tissues within the body. In this context, synaptic transmission between light-excited rod photoreceptors and downstream ON-bipolar neurons is a highly demanding energy consuming process. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a NAD-dependent deacylase, plays a key role in regulating glucose metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is highly expressed in the retina, controlling levels of histone H3K9 and H3K56 acetylation. Notably, despite apparent normal histology, SIRT6 deficiency caused major retinal transmission defects concomitant to changes in expression of glycolytic genes and glutamate receptors, as well as elevated levels of apoptosis in inner retina cells. Our results identify SIRT6 as a critical modulator of retinal function, likely through its effects on chromatin.\nLast Updated (by provider): Feb 21 2018\nContributors:  Kenneth N Ross Dafne M Silberman Raul Mostoslavsky

When the retinal photoreceptors detach from their epithelium, stress signals and apoptotic pathways are initiated that will lead to loss of vision, however accelerating the reattachment of these cells can prevent photoreceptor death and subsequent vision loss.  To determine the genes involved in this process, we performed a microarray screen using a mouse model or retinal detachment in conjunction with a P2Y2 agonist previously demonstrated to hasten retinal reattachment.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jul 01 2016\nContributors:  Rafal Farjo Muna I Naash

Hence, among all diseases, BD has been ranked by the WHO as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity2. Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of BD patients or animal models3, such as reduced glial cell number in the patient prefrontal cortex4, up-regulated activities of the PKA/PKC pathways5-7, and changes in dopamine/5-HT/glutamate neurotransmission systems8-11. However, the roles and causation of these changes in BD are too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease; none of the current BD animal models can recapitulate both the manic and depressive phenotypes or spontaneous cycling of BD simultaneously12,13. Furthermore, while some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment, for yet unknown reasons, other patients are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model has been a challenge for research into BD. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has provided such a new approach. Here, we developed a human BD iPSC model and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons derived from the patient iPSCs. Using patch clamp recording, somatic Ca2+ imaging and RNA-seq techniques, we found that the neurons derived from BD patients exhibited hyperactive action potential (AP) firing, up-regulated expression of PKA/PKC/AP and mitochondria-related genes. Moreover, lithium selectively reversed these alterations in the neurons of patients who responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyper-excitability is one endophenotype of BD that is probably achieved through enhancement in the PKA/PKC and Na+ channel signaling systems, and our BD iPSC model can be used to develop new therapies and drugs aimed at clinical treatment of this disease.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 11 2018\nContributors:  Son Pham Jun Yao Fred H Gage

However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two murine Neurogenin transcription factors in human induced pluripotent stem cells, and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in four days at greater than 90% purity. The high purity enabled mRNA and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the transition from stem cell to neuron. These profiles were then analyzed to identify the regulatory networks underlying the differentiation of the neurons. The arrays presented here assessed the differences between single neurogenin and dual neurogenin expression.\nLast Updated (by provider): Apr 20 2018\nContributors:  Volker Buskamp Nathan Lewis Guye Patrick

Established iPSCs were subsequently differentiated into neuroprogenitors (NPs) and then to neurons. Transcriptomic microarray analysis was conducted on RNA samples from iPSCs, NPs and neurons matured in culture for either 2 weeks (termed early neurons, E) or 4 weeks (termed late neurons, L). Global RNA profiling indicated that BPD and control iPSCs differentiated into NPs and neurons at a similar rate, enabling studies of differentially expressed genes in neurons from controls and BPD cases. Significant disease-associated differences in gene expression were observed only in L neurons. Specifically, 328 genes were differentially expressed between BPD and control L neurons including GAD1, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (2.5 fold) and SCN4B, the voltage gated type IV sodium channel beta subunit (-14.6 fold). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the up-regulation of GAD1 in BPD compared to control L neurons. Gene Ontology, GeneGo and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially regulated genes in L neurons suggest that alterations in RNA biosynthesis and metabolism, protein trafficking as well as receptor signaling pathways GSK3? signaling may play an important role in the pathophysiology of BPD.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 03 2018\nContributors:  Jiangang Liu Steven M Paul Jeffrey L Dage Janice A Egeland Rachelle J Sells Galvin Kwi H Kim Rosamund C Smith Kalpana M Merchant

Among Gb isoforms, Gb5 is unique in its ability to heterodimerize with members of the R7 subfamily of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that contain G protein-g like (GGL) domains.  Previous studies employing Gb5 knockout mice have shown that Gb5 is an essential stabilizer of GGL domain-containing RGS proteins and regulates the deactivation of retinal phototransduction and the proper functioning of retinal bipolar cells.  The purpose of this study is to better understand the functions of Gb5 in the brain outside the visual system by employing molecular biology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging technologies.  We show here that mice lacking Gb5 have a markedly abnormal neurologic phenotype that includes neurobehavioral developmental delay, wide-based gait, motor learning and coordination deficiencies, and hyperactivity.  Using immunohistochemical analysis and a green fluorescent reporter of Purkinje cell maturation we show that the phenotype of Gb5-deficient mice includes, in part, delayed development of the cerebellar cortex, an abnormality that likely contributes to the neurobehavioral phenotype.

Among Gb isoforms, Gb5 is unique in its ability to heterodimerize with members of the R7 subfamily of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that contain G protein-g like (GGL) domains.  Previous studies employing Gb5 knockout mice have shown that Gb5 is an essential stabilizer of GGL domain-containing RGS proteins and regulates the deactivation of retinal phototransduction and the proper functioning of retinal bipolar cells.  The purpose of this study is to better understand the functions of Gb5 in the brain outside the visual system by employing molecular biology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging technologies.  We show here that mice lacking Gb5 have a markedly abnormal neurologic phenotype that includes neurobehavioral developmental delay, wide-based gait, motor learning and coordination deficiencies, and hyperactivity.  Using immunohistochemical analysis and a green fluorescent reporter of Purkinje cell maturation we show that the phenotype of Gb5-deficient mice includes, in part, delayed development of the cerebellar cortex, an abnormality that likely contributes to the neurobehavioral phenotype.  Multiple neuronally-expressed genes are dysregulated in non-cerebellar portion of Gb5 KO mice.\nLast Updated (by provider): Apr 02 2018\nContributors:  William F Simonds Mritunjay Pandey Ching-Kang Chen Erica M Seigneur Weiping Chen Leelamma M Panicker Jian-Hua Zhang Lily Koo

Embryonic conditional deletion of Atrx from multipotent retinal progenitor cells results in the selective loss of the retinal inhibitory interneurons, namely amacrine and horizontal cells. The cell death occurs postnatally after the development of these cell types, peaking at postntal day 17 in the mouse retina.  Identification of molecular factors and pathways that mediate the health and survival of these neurons may suggest novel therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection in ATR-X syndrome and other neurodegenerative diseases. We performed gene expression profiling of wildtype and Atrx conditional knockout mouse retina tissues to identify putative targets of Atrx and molecular pathways that underlie the neurodegenerative phenotype.\nLast Updated (by provider): Feb 21 2018\nContributors:  Pamela S Lagali David J Picketts

Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) were reported to play important roles in mental diseases. However, little was known about their molecular mechanism in pathogenesis of SZ and BD. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on 82 post-mortem brain tissues from three brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)) of patients with SZ and BD and control subjects, generating over one billion reads. We characterized lincRNA transcriptome in the three brain regions and identified 20 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELincRNAs) in BA11 for BD, 34 and 1 in BA24 and BA9 for SZ, respectively. Our results showed that these DELincRNAs exhibited brain region-specific patterns. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we revealed that DELincRNAs together with other genes can function as modules to perform different functions in different brain regions, such as immune system development in BA24 and oligodendrocyte differentiation in BA9. Additionally, we found that DNA methylation alteration could partly explain the dysregulation of lincRNAs, some of which could function as enhancers in the pathogenesis of major psychosis. Together, we performed systematical characterization of dysfunctional lincRNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis, which provided a valuable resource to understand their roles in SZ and BD pathology and helped to discover novel biomarkers.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 26 2018\nContributors:  Jing Hu Jinyuan Xu Lin Pang

We chose three time points: P7, just after the OPL forms and synaptogenesis with BCs begins; P13, as synaptogenesis nears completion and sublamination begins; and P30, when the OPL is mature. We purified cone and rod photoreceptors separately by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using transgene markers: Rhoicre;Ai9 for rods and HRGPcre;Ai9 for cones. We purified ON BCs, which include ON cone bipolars plus rod bipolars using Grm6:GFP. As appropriate transgenic lines to separate RBCs from CBCs were not available, we performed RNAseq on cells from Grm6:GFP mice that were fixed and immunostained prior to FACS, allowing us to purify RBCs (GFP+PKC+) and CBCs (GFP+PKC-) from the same retinas. As PKC is not highly expressed at P7, profiling of developing rod bipolars separate from developing ON cone bipolars was restricted to P13.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 25 2018\nContributors:  Elizabeth Z Sanchez Lawrence S Zipursky Yerbol Z Kurmangaliyev

Horizontal cells and cone photoreceptors share a particularly intimate functional relationship but have been previously thought to develop through separate and distinct intrinsic molecular processes.  We demonstrate that the zinc finger transcription factor Sall3 regulates development of both S-cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells.  Our data shows that loss of function of Sall3 down-regulates the horizontal cell specific transcription factor Lhx1 and subsequently causes ectopic formation of horizontal-like wide-field amacrine cells partially phenocopying Lhx1-/- mice.  Additionally, horizontal cells which laminate appropriately in Sall3 knockout mice show abnormal horizontal cell gene expression and failures in dendritic arborization.  Over-expression of Sall3 also partially re-specifies cells to a horizontal-like wide-field amacrine fate.  Intriguingly, Sall3 loss of function experiments also generated a massive reduction in the number of S-cone photoreceptors with remaining S-cones showing deficiencies in S-cone gene expression and morphology.  Conversely, over-expression of Sall3 resulted in the ectopic expression of the S-cone specific genes S-opsin (Sop) and cone arrestin (Arr3) in electroporated cells.  Our studies reveal that Sall3 regulates aspects of horizontal cell development in two ways: first, by maintaining Lhx1 expression, and second, by directly regulating expression of horizontal cell specific genes.  We also show that Sall3 is an essential regulator of S-cone development in the mammalian retina and a potent activator of Sop and Arr3.\nLast Updated (by provider): Mar 06 2018\nContributors:  Shiming Chen Jimmy de Melo Guang-Hua Peng Seth Blackshaw

Nucleus accumbens (NAC) is a key CNS region for natural rewards and addictions, but to date no study has evaluated on a large scale the events in NAC that underlie the maternal change in natural rewards. In this study we utilized microarray and bioinformatics approaches to evaluate postpartum NAC gene expression changes in mice. Modular Single-set Enrichment Test (MSET) indicated that postpartum (relative to virgin) NAC gene expression profile was significantly enriched for genes related to addiction and reward in 5 of 5 independently curated databases (e.g., Malacards, Phenopedia). Over 100 addiction/reward related genes were identified and these included: Per1, Per2, Arc, Homer2, Creb1, Grm3, Fosb, Gabrb3, Adra2a, Ntrk2, Cry1, Penk, Cartpt, Adcy1, Npy1r, Htr1a, Drd1a, Gria1, and Pdyn. ToppCluster analysis found maternal NAC expression profile to be significantly enriched for genes related to the drug action of nicotine, ketamine, and dronabinol. Pathway analysis indicated postpartum NAC as enriched for RNA processing, CNS development/differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis identified possible networks for transcription factors, including Nr1d1, Per2, Fosb, Egr1, and Nr4a1. The postpartum state involves increased risk for mental health disorders and MSET analysis indicated postpartum NAC to be enriched for genes related to depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Mental health related genes included: Fabp7, Grm3, Penk, and Nr1d1. We confirmed via quantitative PCR Nr1d1, Per2, Grm3, Penk, Drd1a, and Pdyn. This study indicates for the first time that postpartum NAC involves large scale gene expression alterations linked to addiction and reward. Because the postpartum state also involves decreased response to drugs, the findings could provide insights into how to mitigate addictions.\nLast Updated (by provider): Feb 21 2018\nContributors:  S C Gammie C Zhao B E Eisinger T M Driessen

However, many of these associated SNPs are found within intronic or intergenic regions of the human genome.  We were interested in studying transcriptional profiles/splice variation of genes associated with bipolar disorder within the human striatum. Understanding how these associated genes are transcribed in the human brain may help to guide the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 26 2018\nContributors:  Courtney M MacMullen Ronald L Davis Mohammad Fallahi

We have previously generated and characterized Shank3-overexpressing transgenic mice, and found that these mice exhibited manic-like behavioral phenotypes. To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes, we performed transcriptome (RNA-sequencing) analysis of the striatal tissues from 12-week-old wild-type and Shank3 transgenic mice.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jun 25 2018\nContributors:  Kihoon Han Hyojin Kang Yeunkum Lee

This dysfunction is manifest as cognitive deficits that appear to arise from disturbances in gamma frequency oscillations. These oscillations are generated in DLPFC layer 3 via reciprocal connections between pyramidal cells and parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons. The density of cortical PV neurons is not altered in schizophrenia, but expression levels of several transcripts involved in PV cell function, including PV, are lower in the disease.\nLast Updated (by provider): Jul 03 2018\nContributors:  George Tseng Dominique Arion David A Lewis John F Enwright Zhiguang Huo John P Corradi

We showed that the circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERBa, which is associated with bipolar disorder, impacts midbrain dopamine production and mood-related behavior in mice. Genetic deletion of the Rev-erba gene or pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBa activity in the ventral midbrain induced mania-like behavior in association with a central hyperdopaminergic state. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in the ventral midbrains of wild-type (WT) and Rev-erba knock-out (RKO) mice.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: Mar 04 2019\n\nContributors: ; [Sooyoung Chung, Kyungjin Kim, Gi H Son]\nIncludes GDS5628 (Last updated by provider at import time: Aug 21 2015)\n Dataset description GDS5628: Analysis of ventral midbrain (VMB) from Rev-erb? knock-outs that were entrained under a 12hr light-dark photoperiod for &gt;10 days, kept in darkness for 2 days, and sacrificed on the third day.

We have previously generated and characterized Shank3-overexpressing transgenic mice, and found that these mice exhibited manic-like behavioral phenotypes. To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes, we performed transcriptome (RNA-sequencing) analysis of the mPFC tissues from 10 to 12-week-old wild-type and Shank3 transgenic mice.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: Mar 19 2019\n\nContributors: ; [Kihoon Han, Hyojin Kang, Jin Chunmei]

We report the first multi-omics study of neurons isolated from the prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, including genome-wide neuronal DNA methylation using Illumina EPIC microarrays, transcriptomes and SNP genotypes (n=55 cases and 27 controls). Epigenetic, transcriptomic, and genetic-epigenetic interactions in disease converged on pathways of neurodevelopment, synaptic activity, and immune functions. Notably, we discovered prominent hypomethylation of an enhancer within the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene in neurons of major psychosis patients. Chromatin conformation analysis revealed that this enhancer targets the nearby tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, which is responsible for dopamine synthesis. IGF2 enhancer hypomethylation was associated with increased TH protein levels in the human brain. The Igf2 enhancer was deleted in mice to explore the transcriptomic and proteomic consequences of this genomic locus in the frontal cortex and striatum. In mice, Igf2 enhancer deletion disrupted levels of TH protein and striatal dopamine, as well as induced transcriptional and proteomic abnormalities affecting development and synaptic function. Epigenetic control of the IGF2 enhancer may regulate dopamine levels and contribute to psychosis risk.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: May 15 2019\n\nContributors: ; [Shraddha S Pai, Viviane Labrie]

We integrated brain-specific DNase footprinting and TF-gene co-expression to reconstruct a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model for the human brain. We identified key regulator TFs whose predicted target genes were enriched for differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Many of these TFs were further implicated in the same diseases through disruption of their binding sites by disease-associated SNPs and associations of TF loci with disease risk. Using primary human neural stem cells, we validated network predictions that link the TF POU3F2 to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via both cis- and trans-acting mechanisms.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic associations remain unknown. Per3 knockout mice (Per3-/-) have phenotypes related to activity, sleep homeostasis, anhedonia, metabolism, and behavioural responses to light. Using a protocol that induces behavioural differences in response to light in wild type and Per3-/- mice, we compared genome-wide expression in the eye and hypothalamus in the two genotypes. Differentially expressed transcripts were related to inflammation, taste, olfactory and melatonin receptors, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and hormones, as well as receptors and channels related to sleep regulation. Differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues co-localised with Per3 on an ~8Mbp region of distal chromosome 4. The most down-regulated transcript is Prdm16, which is involved in adipocyte differentiation and may mediate altered body mass accumulation in Per3-/- mice. eQTL analysis with BXD mouse strains showed that the expression of some of these transcripts and also others co-localised at distal chromosome 4, is correlated with brain tissue expression levels of Per3 with a highly significant linkage to genetic variation in that region. These data identify a cluster of transcripts on mouse distal chromosome 4 that are co-regulated with Per3 and whose expression levels correlate with those of Per3. This locus lies within a topologically associating domain island that contains many genes with functional links to several of the diverse non-circadian phenotypes associated with polymorphisms in human PER3\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: Mar 09 2020\n\nContributors: ; [Derk-Jan Dijk, Simon N Archer, Daan R van der Veen, Sung-Eun Bae, Jonathan D Johnston, Emma E Laing]

GNL3 knockdown experiments were done in three biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted from GNL3 knockdown and control groups for RNA sequencing (Illumina Hiseq2000, paired-end 100 bp). Genes that affected by both siRNAs were considered differentially expressed genes between GNL3 knockdown and control groups (adjusted P value &lt; 0.05). Using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis, we found that those differentially exrepssed genes were mainly related to immune response, response to cytokine, cell cycle, and p53 signaling pathway.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: May 21 2020\n\nContributors: ; [Chuan Jiao, Qingtuan Meng]

Typically, this phenomenon has been considered maladaptive and may preclude vision restoration in the blind. However, several recent studies utilizing triggered photoreceptor ablation have shown adaptive responses in bipolar cell dendrites expected to support normal vision. Whether such homeostatic plasticity occurs during progressive photoreceptor degenerative disease to help maintain normal visual behavior is unknown. We addressed these issues in an established mouse model of Retinitis Pigmentosa caused by the P23H mutation in rhodopsin. We show robust modulation of the retinal transcriptomic network reminiscent of the neurodevelopmental state as well as potentiation of rod – rod bipolar cell signaling following rod photoreceptor degeneration. Additionally, we found highly sensitive night vision in P23H mice even when more than half of the rod photoreceptors were lost. The results implicate retinal adaptation leading to persistent visual function during photoreceptor degenerative disease.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: Oct 19 2020\n\nContributors: ; [Frans Vinberg, Henri Leinonen]

However, the therapeutic targetsof VPA have remained elusive. Here we  used RNA sequencing  in human  iPSCs derived from  bipolar  patients  to further identify important molecular targets. Human iPSCs were homogenized and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quantity and quality were assessed using fluorometry (Qubit RNA Broad Range Assay Kit and Fluorometer; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and chromatography (Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano Kit; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA (PolyA+) kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced by Illumina NextSeq 500. The read length was 75bp with 30-40M reads per sample. FastQC (v0.11.3) was performed to assess data quality. TopHat2 (v2.0.9) aligned the reads to the mouse reference genome (Mus musculus UCSC mm10) and to the Ensembl human reference genome (GRCh38.p13) using default parameters. Alignments were then converted to expression count data using HTseq (v0.6.1) with default union mode.\nAt time of import, last updated (by provider) on: Dec 31 2020\n\nContributors: ; [George Tseng, Colleen McClung, Wei Zong, Ryan Logan]
